# Changelog

What changed in each version of Shap, newest first. Settings → Updates & backups shows the
entries newer than the version you're running before you update.

## 1.1.5 (20 October 2026)

- **Fewer false twins**: *Costs counted twice* paired costs on amount and date alone, so a car
  wash and an electrical slip of R300 could show as one purchase. Now the supplier's name has to
  match too. Same amount on the same day with different names is listed as *different names:
  check*, unticked.
- **Merging by hand** a cost that the bank shows as a separate payment now works: the copy's
  statement line goes back on the to-do list, for you to leave off or match.
- **Updates show straight away**: after an update the app reloads itself with the new version
  (it checks when you open it or come back to the tab), instead of needing a hard refresh.

## 1.1.4 (20 October 2026)

- **More twins found**: *Costs counted twice* now also lists a statement copy when the cost you
  captured was already tied to the bank, as long as it's the same transaction imported twice
  (the same date and amount in two different statement files), and when the copy's statement
  has since been deleted. Merging also removes the extra statement line. Two real payments of
  the same amount are never folded together.
- **Merge by hand**: open any cost and choose *Counted twice? Find the other one*. It lists
  costs of about the same amount within two weeks; keep this one or that one. The one kept
  takes the other's job, slip and supplier if it had none.

## 1.1.3 (20 October 2026)

- **Statement under the wrong account**: Bank → *Imported statements* lists what you've imported
  for an account. *Move to this account* takes a statement imported under the wrong one (a
  card's statement loaded as the bank's) to the right one: its lines, and every cost, payment
  or entry matched to or added from them, now say they were paid from the right account. Lines
  already imported there are kept once. A transfer that would now be from an account to itself
  is undone, so you can book it again. Statements can be deleted there too.

## 1.1.2 (20 October 2026)

- **Costs counted twice**: a statement line paid for something you'd already captured on a
  job, but from a different account (or a few days earlier), wasn't recognised, so ticking it
  added a second cost with no job. Statement lines are now checked against everything captured
  around that date, whichever account it says paid; the suggestion names the job.
- **Held back, not added twice**: ticking a line that looks already captured no longer adds it;
  you're told to check its suggestion. Choosing *Not this* on the suggestion still lets you add it.
- **Merge the ones already in**: Costs → *Find ones counted twice* (also on Home) lists costs
  added from a statement next to the one you'd captured. Merging keeps yours (job, type, slip),
  records that the statement paid it, and removes the copy.

## 1.1.1 (19 October 2026)

- **Sharing the server**: Caddy now reaches Shap by its own name (`shap-app`). With other apps
  on the shared `edge` network, another app's container called `app` could answer for Shap's
  address instead.

## 1.1.0 (19 October 2026)

- **Bank statements**: a match can be a few cents out (a supplier's or the bank's rounding);
  the biggest item takes the difference so the books follow the statement. Money in that isn't
  a client payment can be booked as income (interest, cashback) or as a refund on a cost type.
- **Statement PDFs**: keep each account's monthly bank statement on file (Accounts → Statement
  PDFs), for you and the accountant. Choose which accounts need them under Settings → Lists;
  Home reminds you of months still to upload.
- **Workers**: an advance can be settled from the worker's page: say it was work on a job, a
  bonus or general work, and the job's costs and the worker's balance follow, back to that date.
- **Jobs close themselves**: once a job is fully invoiced and its invoices are paid (or written
  off as delinquent), it's marked done. Jobs still waiting on quoted work stay open.
- **Parts without a job**: tick them and put them on a job, mark them as not for a job, or change
  their type (advertising, entertainment); either way they leave the list.

## 1.0.0 (19 October 2026)

The first version running a real business's books.

- **Jobs, labour and costs** from the site on a phone: crew days, slips with photos, wages and
  savings, parts plans, and every job's quoted, spent and invoiced side by side.
- **Quotes and invoices** under either trading name (logo, colour, bank details), with deposits,
  a job made straight from a quote or invoice, and no zeros to delete on new lines.
- **Delinquent invoices**: write off what won't be paid as a bad debt, and undo it if they pay.
- **The books** built live from what you capture: income statement, balance sheet, ledger,
  journals, asset register, balance checks, and agreeing a year to the accountant's figures.
- **Provisional tax** estimates on the SARS small business tables.
- **Bank statements**: import the CSV and reconcile it, including slips captured item by item,
  debit orders and bank fees never captured, client payments and transfers.
- **Your tracker and Invoice Ninja clients** brought across, checked against your sheets.
- **Updates and backups from Settings**: see the version, update with one button, back up every
  night and before each update, with copies fetched to your PC.
